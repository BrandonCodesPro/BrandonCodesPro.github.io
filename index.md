## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


Lab 6, part 2
My favorite part about the lab is creating a functional blackjack card counter to check if the card numbers go over the amount. It showed me how I can program all types of functions to calculate things we want like games to count the number of cards or create sandwiches. It also was my favorite because I can basically play blackjack and use this program to count the cards for me.


Lab 8, part 2
This is also one of my favorite labs because it teaches how to create an algorithm to create text patterns. It shows how to use for loops and how manipulating it would create text in a cool order. I liked how it taught how to use iterations to do what you want to create.


Lab 12, part 2
I liked the outcome of this lab assignment. It was like building something blindly or starting at really small parts and as soon as it's put together you can see what creation you have built. This is visually one of my favorite labs because of the gif me and my lab partner created. This project showed me a little bit of what computer science is fully capable of creating and I enjoyed it.
